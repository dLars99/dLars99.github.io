  <p>A cocktail catalog for personal use</p>

  <div>
    <p>
      Several years ago, my wife got into mixology, especially tiki cocktails.
      A typical tiki drink includes many ingredients. This presents two
      challenges:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Keeping track of drink recipes from many different sources
      </li>
      <li>
        Finding a recipe that matches the ingredients you have
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Barkeep is our in-home solution to these problems. At its core is a
      database of drink recipes we have collected. They can be searched by
      regular searches, but also filtered by one or more ingredients to find
      the right recipe for the moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since this is for my personal use, and due to legal implications around
      alcohol, it is not publicly deployed. I run this in a Docker container
      on a home
      <a href="https://unraid.net" class="unraidLink" target="_blank">
        UnRaid
      </a>
      server.
