## Development

### Requirements

You will need:

- Node 18+
- Yarn 2+

### Installation

Installation should be pretty straightforward.

After cloning the repo, run:

```sh
yarn install
```

### Running locally

This, again, should be straightforward.

```sh
yarn start
```

If successful, you will see a message saying the project is running and its port. Default port is `4321`.

### Styling

Styling is done with [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com).
