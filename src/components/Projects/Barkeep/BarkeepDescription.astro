  <p>A cocktail catalog for personal use</p>

  <div>
    <p>
      Several years ago, my wife got into mixology, especially tiki cocktails. A
      typical tiki drink includes many ingredients. This presents two
      challenges:
    </p>

    <ul class={css({ listStyleType: "disc", marginInlineStart: "1em" })}>
      <li>Keeping track of drink recipes from many different sources</li>
      <li>Finding a recipe that matches the ingredients you have</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Barkeep is our in-home solution to these problems. At its core is a
      database of drink recipes we have collected. They can be searched by
      regular searches, but also filtered by one or more ingredients to find the
      right recipe for the moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since this is for my personal use, and due to legal implications around
      alcohol, it is not publicly deployed. I run this in a Docker container on
      a home
      <a href="https://unraid.net" class={css(styles)} target="_blank">
        UnRaid
      </a>
      server.
