  <p>A peer-to-peer network for renting musical equipment</p>

  <div>
    <p>
      GearPatch is a platform for musicians to make some money on their extra
      equipment by renting it to other musicians. A user can request a rental,
      which is then confirmed by the owner. The status of that rental is tracked
      in the owner's inventory.

      This was my fullstack capstone for Nashville Software School, right as I
      was starting my software career. The full project was built in roughly ten
      days.
