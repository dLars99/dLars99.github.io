GearPatch is a platform for musicians to make some money on their extra
equipment by renting it to other musicians. A user can request a rental,
which is then confirmed by the owner. The status of that rental is tracked
in the owner's inventory.

This was my fullstack capstone for Nashville Software School, right as I
was starting my software career. The full project was built in about ten
days.
