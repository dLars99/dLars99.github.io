Creating tabs for your router is easy. Making them meet WAI-ARIA
accessibility standards is not.

Lots of tab libraries give you accessible tabs. Connecting them to your
router, though, means jumping through lots of hoops.

React Routing Tabs gives you accessible tabs that connect to your router
with minimal effort.
