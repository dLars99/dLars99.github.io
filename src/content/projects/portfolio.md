Pretty self-explanatory, since you're looking at it! After having a
templated site that I left untouched for several years, I needed an
update. I also wanted something that was easy-to-maintain, while utilizing
elements of the tech stack I most worked with (React).

While I am not a designer, I had a couple ideas for interactive elements I
wanted to include. Mainly, these included the main navigation "bubble" on
the landing, as well as the expandable headers in the interactive resume
and Projects sections.
