Greener is designed for personal use for individuals who want to keep better track of their lawn care. Features include:

- Log for tracking lawn care chores
- Fully-automated schedule of seasonal tasks with reminders
- Weather data and alerts
- Precipitation monitoring to let the user know if water is needed
- Tips and tricks for a greener lawn

This was my frontend capstone at Nashville Software School. The full
application was built with a mobile-first design in about two weeks.
